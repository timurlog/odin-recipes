        <h3>Brussels sprouts with bacon are roasted in a mixture of maple syrup and olive oil, resulting in a crispy, caramelized side dish that's quick and easy to make and perfect for weeknight dinners. The Brussels sprouts take on a nutty flavor during the roasting process, and the salty bacon is a delightful contrast with the sweet maple syrup — who knew Brussels sprouts with bacon could ever taste this good?</h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound whole Brussels sprouts</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Trim ends off Brussels sprouts and cut any large ones in half. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add bacon, salt, and pepper to the Brussels spouts. Drizzle olive oil and maple syrup over top and toss until sprouts are well coated.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and spread in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy and Brussels sprouts are caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring halfway through.</li>
            <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
